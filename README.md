# Roll20 Analysis

This is a simple notebook for analysing rolls in the online RPG platform [Roll20](https://roll20.net). 
Like most players, at times I assume the rolls aren't quite favouring me, so I thought I'd see how true
it was.

This works with the chat logs from my game, but will have idiosyncrasies that match our homebrew rules,
so anyone else using it may need to tweak the parsing rules.

I've also included a short example chatlog. The input is the 'full page chat log' (HTML) from a Roll20
game.
